## Brief

Reduce support costs for Enterprise Holdings (the rental car company) by designing a new customer service app that allows them to move to internal call centers.

## Strategy

After shadowing existing call center users, the game plan was to build a Google Maps-styled power app that let agents drop pins and find nearby points of interest (tire shops, tow trucks, rental branches, etc.). Users also needed a quick note capability for capturing customer details at any point in the call.

## Challenges

The app needed to balance geo-spatial data and support content, backed by a CDN. As part of the interface we added a support wizard that would guide call center agents through common problem scenarios without making them leave the map interface.

## Outcomes

The app got the name "Hero" and helped support users load rental details, find the customer on a map, and identify the nearest solution to their problem.

The call center is live and being actively used for roadside problems. Coolfire's client passed on feedback from a training session with new workers:

  <p>We got some rave reviews today in the training class... <em>'I’ve worked at a lot of Contact Centers, and in a lot of systems, and this is the best system I’ve worked in. It’s very smooth and user friendly.'</em></p>
