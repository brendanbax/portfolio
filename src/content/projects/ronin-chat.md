## Brief

Design a chat application to demonstrate the capability of Coolfire's Ronin app infrastructure product.

## Strategy

Taking inspiration from Slack, design an interface for group messaging complete with slick animations.

## Challenges

I opted to use InVision Studio to design this interface and leverage some cool animation tools.

## Outcomes

The sample app was built in Flutter by another developer. It went live and was available for download from Github for a time.
