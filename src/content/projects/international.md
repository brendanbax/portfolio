## Brief

Modernize the online mortgage application for a national bank. The new design needed to increase online conversions, with a long-term goal of modeling a new approach to other consumer lending apps.

## Strategy

Build a single page application (SPA) that incrementally moved users along the happy path to lending. It was essential to break the long data-capture process of applying for a loan into smaller chunks of activity to maintain user engagement and increase task completion.

## Challenges

There were **205** initial screens for the new home purchase flow. I leveraged branching logic in the form to allow users to skip questions that weren't relevant to their situation. This increased user confidence in data entry and reduced time on task.

## Outcomes

The application was delivered on-time and Asynchrony Labs was awarded an additional project by the client. Our design system was adopted for other digital products in consumer lending. Mortgage Loan Originators from the bank began referring customers to the online app because of its ease of use and the bank began seeing increased conversions compared to the previous application flow.

  <p>Everyone is so excited about it as it is our first step into creating a first class experience for our customers and, I believe, will be the foundation to move us past our peers in our digital experience. Corporate marketing loved it so much that they are looking at the possibility of a commercial! All of you should take a HUGE amount of pride in the work youâ€™ve already done and the fine tuning to get this perfect. It amazes me every time I do a demo how incredible this looks. I am extremely lucky to work with this kind of talent. You all are amazing and I thank you very much for all of the effort.</p>
