## Brief

Refresh an existing iPad app to improve usability and patient adoption.

## Strategy

I interviewed the nursing staff and mobile development team to understand the limitations of the current app design. Based on their feedback I consolidated user flows to clarify the tasks a user needed to complete.

## Challenges

The app was exclusively for iPads, which were provided to patients. There was a desire to reduce hardware costs by making the app work across devices, so I created a responsive design to facilitate this.

## Outcomes

The entire design process took less than a week and the development team was able to implement the changes within a few weeks.
