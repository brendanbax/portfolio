## Inspiration

My parents raised me and needed a better logo and website for their pottery business, always help your parents.

## Strategy

Design a logo that aligned with their business name, that was also easy to stamp on pottery. Create a 3D print so they can consistently stamp their wares. Build a website with solid product photography, host it for free to save them money.

## Outcomes

Cool website. Check it out, link below.
Awesome 3D printed stamp.
Logo + business cards.
Portfolio of high quality pottery images.
