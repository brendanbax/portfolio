## Inspiration

Tracking homeschool hours is a chore. Other apps were too complicated. Build an app for Android to simplify the process of tracking.

## Strategy

Build a web app with Vue JS, bundled with capacitor, shipped to Android.

## Outcomes

28 downloads in a few months - pulled the app to rewrite for iOS and include cloud storage.
