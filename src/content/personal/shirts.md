## Inspiration

In the early days, my favorite part of learning web development was learning CSS. It was also a huge challenge because of the pre and post processors, browser compatibility, and different technical versions of the language. I decided to celebrate this variety with some fun artwork.

## Strategy

I designed a series of shirts using Affinity Designer. The graphics are available from Cotton Bureau, inspired by Vess soda, in celebration of the various ways of writing CSS.

## Outcomes

Fun shirts for everyone. <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/people/brendan-bax" target="_blank">Go buy one</a>!
