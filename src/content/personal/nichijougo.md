## Inspiration

My friend <a href="https://hertzelle.com" target="_blank">Todd Hertzelle</a> wrote a book on learning Japanese! You can find out more about his book on the <a href="https://nichijougo.com" target="_blank">Nichijougo website</a>. Todd was kind enough to let me design his book cover.

## Strategy

Since the book is all about learning conversational Japanese, I felt it needed to scream "Japan". The target customer is someone wanting to visit Japan or take the N5 test, so it needed to be "on brand". I sent Todd a few cover ideas to mull over. He got feedback from friends and family, before ultimately deciding on the worn "rising sun" design.

## Outcomes

The book is out, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C6C6R8F7?&linkCode=sl1&tag=nichijougo-20&linkId=af98cbf7b80712f812d58ead21b2542e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank">go buy it</a>! My name is on the inside cover, and I'm very grateful to have been a part of this project.
