## Inspiration

Bible study app for small group at church. Wanted to make a fun way to help memorize scripture together. Needed to be simple to access, available across devices, work offline, persist user preferences, be customizable for user translations.

## Strategy

PWA built using Vue JS, leveraging local storage. Content abstracted to a global data collection dynamically loaded per translation.

## Outcomes

Fun app that helped everyone meet their memorization goals and made testing each other super easy.
