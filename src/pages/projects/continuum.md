## Brief

Mercy Virtual, a remote-first hospital, needed a pediatric monitoring app to improve patient wellness through direct communication and vitals monitoring.

## Strategy

Build a mobile app using React Native that facilitates care-team messaging, access to care instructions, and supports video visits to capture vitals. I conducted journey maps and interviews with the pediatric care teams then composed wire frames to get their feedback.

## Challenges

Our innovation team at Mercy was small so I needed to handle user research, design, and development in parallel. I was familiar with React but had never used React Native - so there was additional learning needed.

## Outcomes

The team and I delivered an MVP product, which was ready for the app store in roughly 8 weeks.
