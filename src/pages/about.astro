			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Brendan and I'm an application designer and developer in Wentzville, Missouri. My love for art and technology led me to puruse a
				Bachelor of Science degree in Game Art from Full Sail University. Despite gradutationg Valedictorian in 2010, I was unable to find paying work in the
				industry due to the economy.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make ends meet I worked a variety of jobs including line cook, retail manager, B2B salesman, janitor, hand-dyed-yarn colorist, becoming a licensed
				Realtor, teaching at a technical college, and starting my own business. Ultimatley I decided to learn to code with <a href="" target="_blank"
					>Free Code Camp</a
				>, start building web apps, and I haven't looked back.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a charismatic leader and love teaching, having given career talks about design and user experience to local high school students. Outside of work I
				lead small groups with my church and volunteer in the kids ministry on Sundays.
